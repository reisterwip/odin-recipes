            Whether you're an avid gardener or have a black thumb, one thing is for sure, summer is bursting with 
            fresh basil. Often thought of as a savory herb, this bright green, aromatic addition can actually be used 
            in sweet applications as well. For example, Strawberry Basil Sorbet, Basil Rosemary Orange Shandy, and this 
            delicious lemonade.

        <p>
            This basil lemonade recipe is the perfect canvas for a boozy treat. Try adding a splash of bourbon, vodka, or 
            gin. You could even set up your own spiked lemonade bar at a backyard barbecue for guests to pick and choose 
            how they prefer their refreshing treat. Add extra citrusâ€”like limes, oranges, or grapefruit, or whole fruits 
            like strawberries, peaches, or pineapple.
